* Review samples sort by date...
* (done) Implement MoveFile[AW]
* (done) add compiler detection using yara rules
	- https://github.com/AlienVault-Labs/AlienVaultLabs/tree/master/peid2yar
* (done) add option for dump registry entries (ex. for viewing RT_BITMAPs)
* (done) add option in graph for view data as HEX
* process "dwwin.exe" is doctor watson crash, should be shown in sandbox/processs
* intelligence for registry, if exe written for persistence, should be shown in the files section
* moved files not represented in sandbox/files web gui
* art web gui
   + dinamyc:
	- created files relatonship. Ex: file created and located in registry (regset...)
   + static:
	- (ignored) add internal name, some banner
	- (done) padding comparation versus assigned size (more graphs)?
* (temporary ignored) cache the registry calls (main list) for speedup
* add intelligence to registry parser, not the template
	- (done) monitor uninstall registry key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
* kill any tcpdump process when launching client.py
* (done) better do not hook the pythonw.exe process. See sample: 353f... (add to injector.ini?)
	- This sample is crashing now (may be because the svchost hook?)
* crash when hooking svchost.exe resposible of taskmanager
	- without registry hooks (crashes)
	- without any hook (not crashes -> some hook must be inestable)
	- without reg and file hook -> doesn't crash but something is not well executed...
	- without createfile* (crashes)
	- without copyfile* and movefile* (crashes)
	- check the deletefile functions? the registry again? :/
* (done) Add intelligence for resources with fileoffset negative and mark in red in the web gui
* (done) Add alive status for processes, read processes_final.txt file
* Add comments box or notes for the sections in the web gui
* (done) in affected_processes add all processes (maybe explorer.exe was previously hooked)
* (fixed?) bug when injecting dll into explorer.exe and running some samples? (ex: 4eb07...)
  - note1: disable registry hooking removes the error (try hook explorer.exe launch and close ollydbg.exe)
  - note2: bug must be in regsetW or regqueryW
  - note3: may be error in regqueryvalueexw -> bad WSTRING to char convertion size
* (done, also if resource size > 75% size of file) RT_RCDATA resources highlight in web gui
* Add more OpenProcess dwdesiredaccess flags to logfile
* Implement:
	- RegQueryValue[AW]
	- RegSetValue[AW]
* (skipped, unstable) Implement strings comparison?
* (done) Implement LoadLibraryW
(done) * Create a file with the hooks implemented for displaying better output in the web gui
* (needed?) Implement CreateProcessAsUserSecure
* (done) Implement CreateProcessAsUserW
* (needed?) Implement CreateProcessInternalWSecure
(done) * sort the imports by name and libname, in the web gui
* (done) fix this (handle or hinternet?)
	[26588 ] [InternetConnectA] handle=13369352 "stat.miniload.org" "80"
	[26588 ] [InternetConnectW] hInternet=13369352 "stat.miniload.org" "80"
* (done) wrong navigation on graph (jumps too big for seeing all the data)
(done) * fix open dialog at registry when clicking on same result...
(done) * (not needed, detected with createprocessw) Implement: shellexecute[A|W|ExA]
(done) * Implement: regcreatekeyex 
(done) * parse from log the copied files
* (done) Implement: copyfile
* (done) implement: copyfile*
* (ignore) Check if shellexecute returns a value <=32 (indicates an error)
(partial?)* RegSetValue on handles not identified... :p
* Implement: CreateFileA, RegConnectRegistry, MoveFileEx, DnsQuery, listen, accept, send, recv, recvfrom, WSArecv, WSAsend, bind, internetopen, internetopenurl, internetreadfile, urldownloadtofile, CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, SetWindowsHookExA, winexec, createprocessasuser, createprocesswithlogon, createprocessinternal, createprocessasusersecure, OpenSCManagerA, StartServiceA, ControlService, OpenServiceA, ChangeServiceConfigA, ChangeServiceConfig2A, DeleteService, GetKeyboardState, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, GetForegroundWindow, CreateMutexA, ZwLoadDriver, ZwSetSystemInformation, ReadFileEx, ReadFile, WriteFile
	- (untested-partial) RegConnectRegistry
	- (done) MoveFileEx
	- (done) CreateFile
	- (ignored) ReadFile* and WriteFile
	- (untested-partial) CreateProcessAsUser
	- (done) WinExec (problem: the new process is not detected by createprocess)
	- (done) createprocessinternalA
(done) * detect unicode strings
(done) * load getproccaddress after all the hooks in sinjector
(done) * monitor api for GET and POST
(done) * remove api logging of inet_addr?
(done) * remove duplicated libraries in sandbox results
(fixed?) * bug in detect deleted files script?
* (needed?) Implement: CreateProcessAsUserSecure
(done) * Implement: unsigned long inet_addr( _In_  const char *cp);
(done) * log getprocaddress, match handle with loadlibrary handles in dlltoinject
* do not save remote files not found. Content is: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:...
* log mutex? created and open (also the result)
(done) * detect language of resources
* implement dump of RC_STRING in resources
* add options to display filtered results in sandbox processes web gui
(done) * tcpdump for vm "vboxnet0" iface - require share inet in host for this iface via iptables
* hook by handle on CreateRemoteThread?
(done) * log written registry keys?
* created/deleted folders?
* UNSTABLE: Install .net frameworks: 2.0 sp2, 3.5, 4.0 (windows xp 32 bit)
(done registry hooks fixed) * sample "d33.." and "05a9..." fail in the last compilation of sinjector (bug on registry functions?)
* cmdline in createprocess without quotes on this app failure:
[320   ] [CreateProcessW] PID=15876 Handle=776 Thread=2872 "" C:\WINDOWS\system32\dwwin.exe -x -s 1968
* (dotnet missing) online sample "7981b1d50b8be819192dd0acecc27068" without results. check it :p
(done) * make script to parse registry entries
(done) * The main process doesn't appears in the list
(done) * DLL repeated after parsing (some without extension)->make python script (current is bash)
(launched in bg, not shown again) * remove "sinjector.exe" ini file information on debuglevel=0
(done) * Kill other python instances before launching a new one...
(done) * Refresh only new lines on client.py output, not all log
(done) * Count timeouts, if limit reached, stop execution
(done) * If client is called outside directory can't access files
(done) * The VM may DIE, can't download files->check connection... (?)
(done) * The connection may HANGUP at beginning
(done) * Screenshot after launch the binary
(done online clean install) * Close any unnecesary app or service in saved virtual machine (ex: sandboxie)
(done) * Do not log Sleep 0
(partial) * Implement winsock API logging
* check results for sample df4... 
	* When deleting a file, only one backup is created (last overwrites always) and only one is retrieved, fix this in DLL to inject (backup all) and retrieve all from client
* (check this) Some created procceses have PID=0 (malware bug, openprocess for deleted file?) -> do not REINJECT on PID=0
(registry added)* Add registry log and getprocaddress?
(done) * Remove popup warnings from "sinjector.exe"
* Install .net for this sample??
